                    <img src="<%= assets %>/img/blog/blog-3.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive mb-4">
                    <p>Guest list might be a bit confusing term to some people who are new to nightclubs, bars, and pubs. Today, we are going to explain this term and some more things attached to it. All these nightlife venues maintain their own dignity and culture, and you cannot just enter any nightclub and have your drinks. Well, you can go and have drinks, but at the famous places and the partying places with high demand, it is not easy.</p>

                    <h3 class="color-primary">What is the meaning of guest list in the nightlife venues?</h3>
                    <p>In a simple language, guest list means to have a guaranteed entry (in many cases), as long as you are dressed appropriately and presentable, right look for the right venue. In other words, we can also say, guest list is one of the several ways to determine who gets into an exclusive party.
                      This has its own advantages for both the parties, the club manager will know how the night will be according to the guest list and can manage things depending on the crowd. And, for people who opt for the guest list, they can easily go into the club/bar/pub without having to wait in the long queue wasting their time.</p>
                    <p>In the nightlife venues, believe it or not, people with presentable attitude, appropriate behaviour, looks, and good dressing sense make easier entry on the guest list than others who donâ€™t consider these things seriously. You can also take a look at this discussion about guest list at Tripadvisor to get an overview about the guest list.</P>

                    <h3 class="color-primary">What is the meaning of guest list in the nightlife venues?</h3>

                    <p>For some venues, it is easy. You can just call or book to see yourself on the guest list through their website. But, for popular events, managing things will be a hectic thing, and hence there are people called promoters who can help you get on the guest list.</p>
                    <p>A promoter is a person who promotes a particular party, event or a show. These promoters can be easily seen on social media channels like Instagram, and you can directly message or call them to get you on the guest list. You need to make sure to be on your favorite nightclub through guest list, making arrangements at the last moment, and trying to be on the list before 20 minutes at any venue is a big NO, and no nightclub will accept that.</p>
                    <p>There might be a small twist, getting on the guest list is not everything. It might not entirely mean a guaranteed entry to your favorite nightclub. Other factors matter too, your dress code, behavior, time of arrival, and your attitude.</p>
